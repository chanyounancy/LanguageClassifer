# LanguageClassifer
In this project, I used machine learning techniques(KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression, random forest and gradient boosting) to build language classifiers for Tweets for the The UMass Global English on Twitter Dataset. The package used is Python scikit-learn.
The UMass Global English on Twitter Dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle:
